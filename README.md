## **Task 1: Calculate Factorial Using a Function**

**Problem Statement:**

1. Defines a function named `factorial` that takes a number as an argument and calculates its factorial using a loop or recursion.  
2. Returns the calculated factorial.  
3. Calls the function with a sample number and prints the output.

**Expected Output:**

For example, if the function is called with 5, it should return:

Enter a number: 5

## **Task 2: Using the Math Module for Calculations**

**Problem Statement:**

1. Asks the user for a number as input.  
2. Uses the `math` module to calculate the:
   - Square root of the number  
   - Natural logarithm (log base e) of the number  
   - Sine of the number (in radians)  
3. Displays the calculated results.

**Expected Output:**

For example, if the user enters 25, the output should be:

Enter a number: 25

Square root: 5.0

Logarithm: 3.2188758248682006

Sine: -0.13235175009777303
